# SliceNStitch: Continuous CP Decomposition of Sparse Tensor Streams

Source code for SliceNStitch, described in the paper [SliceNStitch: Continuous CP Decomposition of Sparse Tensor Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11517.pdf) by [Taehyung Kwon](https://github.com/kbrother)\*, [Inkyu Park](https://github.com/yunik1004)\*, [Dongjin Lee](https://github.com/wooner49), and [Kijung Shin](https://kijungs.github.io/), to be presented at [ICDE 2021](https://icde2021.gr/).

**SliceNStitch** is an algorithm for continous CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, which has numerous time-critical applications.
It has the following properties:

* *Any time*: updates factor matrices immediately without having to wait until the current time period ends
* *Fast*: with constant-time updates up to 464x faster than online methods
* *Accurate*: with fitness comparable (specifically, 72 - 100%) to offline methods.

## Requirements

* C/C++17 compiler
* CMake
* Git

## Used Libraries

* Eigen (<https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen>)
* yaml-cpp (<https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp>)

## Download

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DMLab-Tensor/SliceNStitch.git
```

## Generate Build System

To generate the build system, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
```

After that, you can build the program using the build automation software (e.g. Make, Ninja).

## Execution

To test the algorithms in the paper, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
./SliceNStitch [config_file]
```

## Config File

### Example config file

```yaml
# test.yaml
data:
    filePath: "nyt_2019.csv"  # Path of the data stream file
    nonTempDim: [265, 265]  # Non-temporal dimension
    tempDim: 5184000  # Temporal length of data stream

tensor:
    unitNum: 10  # The number of indices in the time mode (W)
    unitSize: 3600  # Period (T)
    rank: 20  # Rank of CPD (R)

algorithm:
    name: "SNS_RND+"
    settings:  # Details are described in the next section
        numSample: 20
        clipping: 1000.0

test:
    outputPath: "out.txt"  # Path of the output file
    startTime: 0  # Starting time of the input data to be processed
    numEpoch: 180000  # The number of epochs
    checkPeriod: 1  # Period of printing the error
    updatePeriod: 1  # Period of updating the tensor
    random: true  # Randomness of the initial points
```

### Examples of Possible Algorithms

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "ALS"
    settings:
```

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "SNS_MAT"
    settings:
        numIter: 1
```

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "SNS_VEC"
    settings:
```

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "SNS_VEC+"
    settings:
        clipping: 1000.0  # Clipping value (η)
```

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "SNS_RND"
    settings:
        numSample: 20  # Threshold (θ)
```

```yaml
algorithm:
    name: "SNS_RND+"
    settings:
        numSample: 20  # Threshold (θ)
        clipping: 1000.0  # Clipping value (η)
```

## Input & Output Format

Input (data:filePath in a config file) must be a CSV file that consists of a multi-aspect data stream.
Each row of the file is a single event and the file should be formatted as follows.

For a CSV file with N columns,

* First (N-2) columns represent the non-temporal indices of events
* The (N-1)th column represents the time indices of events
* The last column represents the values of events

The output (test:outputPath) of the code will be:
```
-----Test Results-----
RMSE	Fitness
0.33438	0.675436
0.329659 0.639608
...
0.37203	0.692263

-----The Total Number of Updates-----
4030721

-----Total Elapse Time-----
330.706 (sec)

-----Elapse Time per each Update-----
8.20463e-05 (sec)
```
